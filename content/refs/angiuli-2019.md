Dependent type theories are a family of logical systems that serve as expressive functional programming languages and as the basis of many proof assistants. In the past decade, type theories have also attracted the attention of mathematicians due to surprising connections with homotopy theory the study of these connections, known as homotopy type theory, has in turn suggested novel extensions to type theory, including higher inductive types and Voevodskys univalence axiom. However, in their original axiomatic presentation, these extensions lack computational content, making them unusable as programming constructs and unergonomic in proof assistants.
