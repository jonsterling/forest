title: Univalent Foundations
---

Trees tagged with **Univalent Foundations** are guaranteed to be compatible with the assumptions of Voevodsky's univalent foundations. They may implicitly assume univalence and propositional resizing, but they do not assume global UIP nor other anti-univalent principles such as global choice. Of course, because of the conservativity of univalent mathematics over set-level mathematics, set-level results are generally applicable.
