We describe three different kinds of morphism between geometric universes.

1. A *partial cartesian morphism* $f : E \to F$ is a pullback preserving functor $f:E\to F$.
2. A *cartesian morphism* $f : E \to F$ is a partial cartesian morphism $f : E\to F$ that preserves the terminal object.
4. A *logical morphism* $f : E \to F$ is a cartesian morphism $f : E \to F$ that additionally preserves the subobject classifier.
3. An *algebraic morphism* $f : E \to F$ is a pair $f = (\InvImg{f}\dashv \DirImg{f})$ such that $\InvImg{f} : E \to F$ a cartesian morphism of geometric universes. The left adjoint $\InvImg{f}$ is called the *inverse image* and the right adjoint $\DirImg{f}$ is called the *direct image*.
