title: Fibrations of geometric universes
---

Logical morphisms play an important role in the study of geometric universes; in particular, the most important notion of *fibered* geometric universe involves logical morphisms rather than algebraic morphisms.

It will follow in the scenario of [](frct-003E), the total category $\TotCat{E}$ is a geometric universe and the projection $\TotCat{E}\to B$ is both a logical morphism of geometric universes and an algebraic morphism of geometric universes. Moreover, the Artin gluing theory of geometric universes will reveal that there exists a subterminal object $U\rightarrowtail \ObjTerm{\TotCat{E}}$ such that $\TotCat{E}\to B$ factors as  $\TotCat{E}\to \Sl{\TotCat{E}}{U} \simeq B$; indeed, $U$ is the initial object of the fiber category $E\Sub{\ObjTerm{B}}$. Then $F = E\Sub{\ObjTerm{B}}$ will be revealed to be equivalent to the full subcategory of $\TotCat{E}$ spanned by objects $X$ such that the projection $X\times U\to U$ is an isomorphism.
