Let $E$ be a logical fibration of geometric universes over a geometric universe $B$. Then the following are equivalent:

1. $E$ has stable and disjoint sums over $B$.
2. $E$ is the *gluing fibration* for a cartesian morphism $B\to F$ of geometric universes.

Indeed, in the situation described above we may define $F$ to be the fiber $E\Sub{\ObjTerm{B}}$ over the terminal object. The functor $B\to E\Sub{\ObjTerm{B}}$ sends each $b\in B$ to the sum $\coprod_{b}\ObjTerm{E}$.
