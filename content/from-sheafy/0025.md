Let $E$ be a geometric universe. A $E$-*topos* $X$ or a *topos in
$E$* is defined to be a geometric universe $\Sh{X}$ equipped with an algebraic morphism $X:E\to\Sh{X}$ whose gluing fibration $\GL{X}$ has a
small separator {%pref 002H%}. A morphism of $E$-topoi $f:{X}\to{Y}$ is defined by an algebraic
morphism $\Sh{f}:\Sh{Y}\to\Sh{X}$ of geometric universes equipped with
a 2-isomorphism $\varphi_{f}:X \cong Y;\Sh{f}$ in $[E,\Sh{X}]$.

It will often be convenient to display pasting diagrams as *string diagrams*,
which we read in diagrammatic order from top left to bottom right. A string
diagram views 2-cell as a "transformer" through which information passes
along a wire; the input/output interface of such a transformer is written on
the wires. Regions of whitespace denote objects of the ambient 2-category. Our pasting diagram above is depicted as a string diagram in $\AlgGU$ below:
{%tex macrolib: topos%}
\begin{ZX}
\zxN{} &\dar[close]{X}\\
\zxN{} &\zxX[pilr]{\varphi_f}\dlar[swap,-o,close]{Y}\drar[N,close]{\Sh{f}}\\[3mm]
\zxN{} & \zxN{} & \zxN{}
\end{ZX}

A 2-morphism $\alpha:{f}\to{g}$ in $[X,Y]$ is defined to be a
2-morphism $\Sh{\alpha}:\Sh{f}\to{\Sh{g}}$ compatible with $\varphi_{f},\varphi_{g}$
in the sense that the following pasting diagrams are equal:
{%tex macrolib: topos%}
  \begin{tikzpicture}[diagram,baseline=(S/X.base)]
    \node (E) {$E$};
    \node (S/Y) [below left = of E] {$\Sh{Y}$};
    \node (S/X) [below right = of E] {$\Sh{X}$};
    \draw[->] (E) to node [sloped,above] {$Y$} (S/Y);
    \draw[->] (S/Y) to node (S/f) [upright desc] {$\Sh{f}$} (S/X);
    \draw[->] (E) to node [sloped,above] {$X$} (S/X);
    \draw[->,bend right=60] (S/Y) to node (S/g) [below] {$\Sh{g}$} (S/X);
    \node [between = E and S/f] {$\varphi_{f}$};
    \node [between = S/g.north and S/f] {$\Sh{\alpha}$};
  \end{tikzpicture}
  =
  \begin{tikzpicture}[diagram,baseline=(S/X.base)]
    \node (E) {$E$};
    \node (S/Y) [below left = of E] {$\Sh{Y}$};
    \node (S/X) [below right = of E] {$\Sh{X}$};
    \draw[->] (E) to node [sloped,above] {$Y$} (S/Y);
    \draw[->] (E) to node [sloped,above] {$X$} (S/X);
    \draw[->,bend right=60] (S/Y) to node (S/g) [below] {$\Sh{g}$} (S/X);
    \node [between = S/Y and S/X] {$\varphi_g$};
  \end{tikzpicture}

We may likewise represent the equation above in terms of string diagrams.
{%tex macrolib: topos%}
\begin{ZX}
  \zxN{} &\dar[close]{X}\\
   \zxN{} & \zxX[pilr]{\varphi_f} \arrow[-N', near end, close, swap]{ddl}{Y} \drar[N, close, pos=.6]{\Sh{f}}\\
   \zxN{} & \zxN{} & \zxX[pilr]{\Sh{\alpha}} \dar{\Sh{g}}\\
   \zxN{} & \zxN{} & \zxN{}
\end{ZX}
=
\begin{ZX}
  \zxN{} &\dar[close]{X}\\
  \zxN{} &\zxX[pilr]{\varphi_g}\dlar[swap,-o,close]{Y}\drar[N,close]{\Sh{g}}\\[3mm]
  \zxN{} & \zxN{} & \zxN{}
\end{ZX}
