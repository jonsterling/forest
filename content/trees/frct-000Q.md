We adapt Bénabou's construction as reported by [Streicher](streicher-fcjb). Our [first construction](frct-001Z) works for an [uncloven](frct-003T) fibration, but it has the downside that it requires us to treat the collection of cartesian lifts as a set that can be quotiented, whereas our [second construction](frct-003W) avoids this by virtue of a [cleaving](frct-003T). Up to equivalence, the two constructions coincide for a cloven fibration, which shows that our second construction is independent of the chosen cleaving.

Going forward, we will not be sensitive to the difference between the two constructions of opposite fibrations.
