Let $\mathscr{M}$ be a model of ETCS; and let $\mathfrak{C}$ be a
class of families of sets in $\mathscr{M}$. Then $\mathfrak{C}$ is a class of
objects in the fundamental self-indexing $\SelfIx{\mathscr{M}}$ over
$\mathscr{M}$.  Furthermore, $\mathscr{M}$ a definable class in
$\SelfIx{\mathscr{M}}$ in the sense of [](frct-002W) if and only if it is a definable class of families of sets in the sense of [](frct-002P).
