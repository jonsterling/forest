A morphism $\bar{f}:\bar{x}\to\Sub{f} \bar{y}\in\OpCat{E}$ is cartesian
over $f:x\to y$ if and only if the vertical leg of $f$ is an isomorphism.

{{%proof%}}

Suppose that $\bar{f} : \bar{x}\to\Sub{f}\bar{y}$ is represented by a span $\brc{\bar{x}\leftarrow\bar{y}\Sub{x}\to\bar{y}}$ in $E$ in which the vertical leg $\bar{x}\leftarrow\bar{y}\Sub{x}$ is an isomorphism. We must show that $\bar{x}\to_f\bar{y}$ is cartesian in $\OpCat{E}$. We fix a morphism $\bar{h}:\bar{w}\to\Sub{m;f}\bar{y}\in \OpCat{E}$ where $m:w\to x$, depicted below in terms of $\OpCat{E}$:
```render-latex
\begin{tikzpicture}[diagram]
  \SpliceDiagramSquare{
    west/style = lies over,
    east/style = lies over,
    north/node/style = upright desc,
    height = 1.5cm,
    nw = \bar{x},
    ne = \bar{y},
    sw = x,
    se = y,
    south = f,
    north = \bar{f},
  }
  \node (w) [left = of sw] {$w$};
  \node (w') [left = of nw] {$\bar{w}$};
  \draw[lies over] (w') to (w);
  \draw[->] (w) to node [below] {$m$} (sw);
  \draw[bend left=30] (w') to node [above] {$\bar{h}$} (ne);
\end{tikzpicture}
```

We must define the unique intervening map $\bar{w}\to_m \bar{x}$ in $\OpCat{E}$.
We first translate the above into the language of $E$ by unfolding definitions:
```render-latex
\begin{tikzpicture}[diagram]
  \SpliceDiagramSquare<0/>{
    west/style = lies over,
    east/style = lies over,
    north/style = {<-},
    south/style = double,
    height = 1.5cm,
    nw = \bar{w},
    sw = w,
    se = w,
    ne = \bar{y}\Sub{w},
    north = \bar{h},
    ne/style = pullback,
  }
  \SpliceDiagramSquare<1/>{
    glue = west,
    glue target = 0/,
    east/style = lies over,
    height = 1.5cm,
    ne/style = pullback,
    se = x,
    ne = \bar{y}\Sub{x}\cong \bar{x},
    south = m,
  }
  \SpliceDiagramSquare<2/>{
    glue = west,
    glue target = 1/,
    east/style = lies over,
    height = 1.5cm,
    se = y,
    ne = \bar{y},
    south = f,
    north = \bar{f},
  }
\end{tikzpicture}
```

The desired intervening map $\bar{w}\to\Sub{m} \bar{x}\in \OpCat{E}$ shakes out in the language of $E$ to be a span $\brc{\bar{w}\leftarrow \bar{x}\Sub{w}\to\Sub{m} \bar{x}}$ in which the left-hand leg is vertical and the right-hand leg is cartesian over $m:w\to x$. But the left-hand span $\brc{\bar{w}\leftarrow\bar{y}\Sub{w}\to \bar{y}\Sub{x}\cong \bar{x}}$ in the diagram above is exactly what we need.

We leave the converse to the reader.
