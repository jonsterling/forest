Let {#I\subseteq A#} be a semidirected subset of a [pointed](jms-001S) dcpo {#A#}; then the intersection {#I \cap A^+#} is semidirected, where {#A^+#} is the [subdcpo spanned by positive elements](jms-001P).

{{%proof%}}
Let {#i,j#} be two [positive](jms-001M) elements of {#I#}; we must show that there exists a positive element {#k\in I#} such that {#i\sqsubseteq k#} and {#j\sqsubseteq k#}. This follows immediately from the directedness of {#I#} and [the fact that positivity is monotone](jms-0029).
