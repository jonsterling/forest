title: globally small fibrations
---

In ordinary category theory, a category {#C#} is called *small* when the objects of {#C#} can be arranged into a set, and so can for every {#x,y\in C#} the collection of morphisms {#x\to y#}. It is useful to separate these two conditions when we generalize them to fibrations. The latter is called [*local smallness*](frct-000F); the former is called *global smallness* by [Jacobs](jacobs-1999) and factors through an important concept: the *generic object*.
