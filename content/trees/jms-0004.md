If a sequence {#\Sequence{A}{f}{B}{g}{C}#} in an abelian category is [exact](jms-0002) at {#B#}, then it is [complex](jms-0002).

{{%proof%}}
By exactness at {#B#} we may assume {#\Ker{g}=\Img{f}#}; we must show that {#f;g=0#}. Based on our assumption, we see that {#f;g#} factors through the zero morphism as follows:

```render-latex
\begin{tikzpicture}[diagram]
  \node (A) {$A$};
  \node[right = of A] (ker/g) {$\Ker{g}$};
  \node[right = of ker/g] (B) {$B$};
  \node[right = of B] (C) {$C$};
  \draw[->>] (A) to (ker/g);
  \draw[>->] (ker/g) to (B);
  \draw[->] (B) to node[below] {$g$} (C);
  \draw[->,bend right=30] (A) to node[below] {$f$} (B);
  \draw[->, bend left=30] (ker/g) to node[above] {$0$} (C);
\end{tikzpicture}
```

Any morphism factoring through zero must be zero.
