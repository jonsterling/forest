An ordinary category {#E#} is called *locally small* when for any {#x,y\in E#} the collection of morphisms {#x\to y#} is a set.  This property of {#E#} can be rephrased in terms of its [family fibration](frct-0006) {#\FAM{E}#} over {#\SET#} as follows.

Consider an index set {#I\in \SET#} and two families {#u,v\in C^I#}. We may define
an {#I#}-indexed collection {#\brk{u,v}\Sub{i\in I}#} consisting (pointwise) of all the
morphisms {#u\Sub{i}\to v\Sub{i}#} in {#C#}:
{##\brk{u,v}\Sub{i} = \brc{ f \mid f: u\Sub{i}\to v\Sub{i} }##}

If {#C#} is locally small, {#\brk{u,v}\Sub{i\in I}#} is in fact a family of sets for
any {#I\in\SET#} as each {#\brk{u,v}\Sub{i}#} is a set. Conversely, if {#\brk{u,v}\Sub{i\in I}#}
is a family of sets for any {#I\in \SET#}, then {#C#} is locally small as we may
consider in particular the case that {#I=\mathbf{1}#}.
