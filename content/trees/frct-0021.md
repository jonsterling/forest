The displayed category {#\OpCat{E}#} is a cartesian fibration.

{{%proof%}}
Fixing {#\bar{y}\in \OpCat{E}\Sub{y}#} and {#f:x\to y\in B#}, we must
exhibit a cartesian lift {#\bar{f} : \bar{x}\to\Sub{f}\bar{y}\in \OpCat{E}#}.
By the [characterization](frct-000T) it suffices to find *any* map over {#f#} whose vertical component is an isomorphism. Writing {#\bar{y}\Sub{x}\to\Sub{f}\bar{y}#} for the cartesian lift of {#f#} in {#E#}, consider the map in {#\OpCat{E}#} presented by the following span in {#E#}:
```render-latex
\begin{tikzpicture}[diagram]
  \SpliceDiagramSquare<l/>{
    nw = \bar{y}\Sub{x},
    ne = \bar{y}\Sub{x},
    sw = x,
    se = x,
    north/style = double,
    south/style = double,
    west/style = lies over,
    east/style = lies over,
    ne/style = pullback,
    height = 1.5cm,
  }
  \SpliceDiagramSquare<r/>{
    glue = west,
    glue target = l/,
    height = 1.5cm,
    east/style = lies over,
    ne = \bar{y},
    se = y,
    south = f,
  }
\end{tikzpicture}
```
