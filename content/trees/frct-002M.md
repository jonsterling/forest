title: closure of a class of sets under base change

Let {#\mathfrak{C}\subseteq\mathscr{M}#} be a class of sets; there exists a class {#\bar{\mathfrak{C}}#} of *families*
of sets that contains {#\prn{S\Sub{i}}\Sub{i\in I}#} exactly when each
{#S\Sub{i}#} lies in {#\mathfrak{C}#}. We will refer to {#\bar{\mathfrak{C}}#} as the *closure under base change* of {#\mathfrak{C}#}, a name motivated by the fact that when {#\prn{S\Sub{i}}\Sub{i\in I}#} lies in {#\bar{\mathfrak{C}}#},
then for any {#u:J\to I#}, the base change {#\prn{S\Sub{uj}}\Sub{j\in J}#} also lies in {#\bar{\mathfrak{C}}#}.
