Let {#A#} be a [pointed](jms-001S) dcpo with an [open positivity predicate](jms-0022); we define the "purification" map {#\Mor{\Purify_A}{A}{\Lift{A^+}}#} into the lift of the [subdcpo of positive elements](jms-001P) to send {#a\in A#} to the partial element {#\prn{\IsPos\,{a},\lambda p. a}#}; we note:

{## \Purify_Aa = \prn{\IsPos\,{a},\lambda p. a} = \bigsqcup_{p:\IsPos\,a}\eta_Aa##}

The mapping defined above  is continuous because we have assumed that {#A#} has an [open positivity predicate](jms-0022), so its domain of definition defines a Scott-open subdcpo of {#A#}.
