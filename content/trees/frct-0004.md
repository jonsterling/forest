Let {#E#} be displayed over {#B#} and let {#F#} be displayed over {#C#}. If {#U:B \to C#}
is an ordinary functor, than a *displayed functor* from {#E#} to {#F#} over {#U#} is
given by the following data:

1. for each displayed object {#\bar{x}\in E\Sub{x}#}, a displayed object {#\bar{U}\bar{x}\in F\Sub{Ux}#},
2. for each displayed morphism {#\bar{f} : \bar{x}\DispTo{f}\bar{y}#}, a displayed morphism {#\bar{U}\bar{f} : \bar{U}\bar{x}\DispTo{Uf}\bar{U}\bar{y}#},
3. such that the assignment {#\bar{U}f#} preserves displayed identities and displayed composition.

From this notion, we can see the variation of displayed categories over their
base categories itself has a "displayed categorical" structure; up to size
issues, we could speak of the displayed *bicategory* of displayed categories.

**Note.** The correct notion of morphism between cartesian fibrations is given
by displayed functors that preserve cartesian maps. We will call these *fibered
functors*.
