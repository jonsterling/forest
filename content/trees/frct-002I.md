Let $\bar{s}$ be a displayed object in a cartesian fibration $E$ over $B$.
A pair of displayed morphisms $f,g:\bar{x}\to \bar{y}\in E$ are said to
*agree on $\bar{s}$-figures* when for any $\bar{s}$-figure
$h : \bar{z}\to \bar{x}$ in the sense of [](frct-002K), we have $h;f = h;g : \bar{z}\to \bar{y}$.
