A displayed category {#E#} over {#B#} is said to be a *cartesian fibration*, when
for each morphism {#f : x \to y#} and displayed object {#\bar{y}\in E\Sub{y}#}, there
exists a displayed object {#\bar{x}\in E\Sub{x}#} and a *cartesian* morphism
{#\bar{f} : \bar{x}\DispTo{f} \bar{y}#} in the sense of [](frct-0001). Note that the pair {#(\bar{x},\bar{f})#} is unique up to
unique isomorphism, so being a cartesian fibration is a *property* of a displayed category.

There are other variations of fibration. For instance, {#E#} is said to be an *isofibration* when the condition above holds just for isomorphisms {#f : x\cong y#} in the base.
