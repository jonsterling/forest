Universes started their life in the [Grothendieck school of algebraic geometry](sga-4) as a technical device to circumvent the annoyance that there cannot be a "set of all sets"; a universe is a set of enough sets, and whilst a universe cannot contain itself, it may nonetheless lie within an even bigger universe. Several important developments in the theory of universes from the 1970s onward by Bénabou, Martin-Löf, Dybjer, Hofmann, Streicher, Awodey, and others have collided to deliver the present-day understanding of the centrality of universes in semantics: a model of type theory is just a special kind of universe in a special kind of category. This chapter provides expository background on the theory of universes, including a novel account of open and closed subuniverses to reflect the recollement theory of topoi from [Chapter 2](jms-0010). These open and closed subuniverses will play a critical role in the development of synthetic Tait computability in subsequent chapters.
