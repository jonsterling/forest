Let {#E#} be a cartesian fibration
over {#B#}; then any displayed object {#\bar{x} \in E\Sub{x}#} induces a *full subfibration* {#\FullSubfib{\bar{u}}\subseteq E#} spanned by displayed objects that are classified by {#\bar{u}#}, i.e. arise from {#\bar{u}#} by cartesian lift.

1. An object of {#\FullSubfib{\bar{u}}\Sub{x}#} is specified by an object {#\bar{x}\in E\Sub{x}#} together with a cartesian morphism {#\bar{x}\to \bar{u}#}.

2. Given {#f:x\to y\in B#}, a morphism from {#\bar{x}\to \bar{u}#} to {#\bar{y}\to\bar{u}\in#} over {#f#} is given by any displayed morphism {#\bar{x}\to\Sub{f}\bar{y}#}.
