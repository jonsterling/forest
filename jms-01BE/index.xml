  <fr:mainmatter>
    <html:p>Anyway, I believe I shall be Chair of Examiners for Part IA next year. Many of the actual questions of policy are naturally out of my hands in this role, but I hope to direct the examination and assessment process for IA in as anti-bureaucratic a way that can possibly be achieved whilst working within those policies. Any colleagues who have suggestions for practicable improvements to the process are very welcome to have a chat with me about it.</html:p>
    <html:p>
      <html:mark>One change I plan to make straightaway is to reform the Examiners’ interaction with setters to be more directly collaborative and less bureaucratic.</html:mark>
    </html:p>
    <html:p>Right now, Examiners read all the questions and try their best to come up with criticisms of them (despite our individual uncertain expertise in at least two-thirds of the Paper content). These criticisms are then collated and sent to each setter as a list of requested changes; I believe that a list of changes passed indirectly from the Examiners to the setters is not the most collaborative way to achieve a high quality exam paper. <html:strong><html:em>(I sincerely apologise to anyone who has been on the other end of an interaction like this recently: I have heard you, and I will fix it).</html:em></html:strong></html:p>
    <html:p>A different approach, which I have heard was actually practised prior to the pandemic, was that Examiners would simply hold court and have walk-in chats with setters and iron things out in person without a bureaucratic back-and-forth. Count me in! We will do something like that next year, making necessary allowances for setters’ availability.</html:p>
    <html:p>To be honest, every time I hear about how things used to be in the <fr:link href="/camcl/" title="Cambridge Computer Laboratory" uri="https://www.jonmsterling.com/camcl/" display-uri="camcl" type="local">Lab</fr:link> before the pandemic, I think to myself that we should simply look for every single policy or procedural change that occurred since that era began and simply reverse it and then potentially revisit with the benefit of hindsight. My proposal? <html:code>git checkout -b new-era; git reset --hard HEAD~2000</html:code> and Godspeed.</html:p>

            <html:p>Marking season begins… I must mark at a clip of approximately four Part II dissertations per day (including weekend) if I want to have any chance of making our extremely tight deadline. At Cambridge, we have an uncommonly cautious approach to assessment:</html:p>
            <html:ol><html:li>For examination Papers, questions pass through several redundant layers of checking. Each question has a designated “checker” in addition to the setter. Then after the checker is happy with the question, it goes on to the Examiners, who check each Paper globally and send back suggestions and requests to the setter. After all this, it goes on to an External Examiner (from a different university!), who gives additional feedback.</html:li>
    <html:li>Part II project dissertations are marked not only by the UTO supervisor (who is either the actual supervisor or a “meta-supervisor-at-a-distance” of a non-UTO supervisor who is often a PhD student). They are also marked by a second assessor, who is often one of the Examiners but may also be brought onto the team to contribute to marking. For example, I am a Part IA Examiner but I am marking Part II dissertations in addition to my Examiners’ duties.</html:li></html:ol>

                <html:p>Our fastidious approach to question setting has some definite advantages, but overall it is far too bureaucratic and has too many levels. An immense amount of time is burnt second-guessing question-setters, in the end leading to doubtful benefits. My colleagues at literally every university in the World except for Oxford are always shocked when I explain this process to them—at normal universities, you just set and mark an exam, and nobody else sees it (aside from the TAs you enlist to help you mark it—something else we don’t do here). This actually works fine at literally every university on the planet except for two.</html:p>
                <html:p>On the other hand, the redundant marking of Part II dissertations is a bit more complex, and there are some stronger reasons for it. One reason is concern over conflicts of interest or supervisors’ natural overenthusiasm for their students’ projects, but I am not convinced by this one. I must comment that this level of redundant project marking is not seen as necessary at almost any other university. On the other hand, a slightly more convincing reason for having a non-supervisor mark the dissertation is that the latter will usually be an outsider to the topic of specialisation; this ensures that dissertations can be read by someone literate in general computer science who is not a specialist, and this legibility is actually one of the goals of the Part II programme. I am more convinced by this, but not entirely—computer science is not really one field anymore, and it is a bit of a shared delusion that it is <html:em>ever</html:em> possible anymore to write up a substantive project in such a way that “the average member of the <fr:link href="/camcl/" title="Cambridge Computer Laboratory" uri="https://www.jonmsterling.com/camcl/" display-uri="camcl" type="local">Computer Lab</fr:link>” would be able to assess its merits intelligently.</html:p>
                <html:p>Anyway, I have a feeling that if we cut in half the amount of marking we do, and divided by three the amount of scrutiny we impose on question-setting for examinations, the outcomes for our students would be qualitatively similar to what they are now. It is always possible to raise “important” concerns about the integrity of the process whose “solution” is naturally ever-more layers of redundancy and checking-the-checkers-who-check-the-checkers-of-the-setter-checkers. <html:mark>At moments like this, it is a good idea to pause and reflect on whether it is better for our students that each faculty member spend a cumulative two months doing literally nothing but assessment and higher-order practices related to assessment, vs. other activities that could benefit our students more (<html:strong>including <html:em>actual teaching</html:em></html:strong>, of which we do astonishingly little at Cambridge).</html:mark></html:p>
