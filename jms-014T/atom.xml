        <p>David Allen’s <em>Getting Things Done</em> (GTD) task management system suggests tagging tasks with <em>contexts</em>, which describe the conditions that <strong>must</strong> be in place in order to carry out a given task. These conditions often are of the form “I am in my office” or “I am at home” or “I am on my laptop”; these could be coded as <code>@Office</code>, <code>@Home</code>, <code>@Laptop</code> respectively.</p>
        <p>One subtlety of this design is the meaning of tagging a task with multiple contexts. Does <code>@X @Y</code> mean the <em>conjunction</em> or the <em>disjunction</em> of the <code>@X</code> and <code>@Y</code>? I think the disjunctive semantics is better, and it suggests a rephrasing of the usual GTD mantra about contexts: a context of a task describes <em>any</em> condition under which it can possibly be achieved, rather than <em>the</em> conditions that are required.</p>
        <p>For example, sometimes I will tag something as <code>@Lab @College</code> because it is a task that I can carry out in <em>either</em> my <a href="https://www.jonmsterling.com/camcl/">Computer Laboratory</a> office <em>or</em> my <a href="https://www.jonmsterling.com/jms-00GP/">College</a> office. Although it can look strange to people familiar with tagging for other purposes, the goal here is that when I reach College, I filter my tasks by the <code>@College</code> context and see anything that I could reasonably undertake at that moment.</p>
        <p>Would it be better to have a more sophisticated logic of contexts that accommodates any combination of disjunction and conjunction? Perhaps, but I think that might lead to enhanced f***arounditis rather than enhanced productivity.</p>

        <p>Reading <a href="https://www.jonmsterling.com/ostrovsky-1936/">How the Steel was Tempered</a>, I am struck by the way the narrative takes a definite position—it is for <em>us</em>, children of the future!—without cloaking itself in the viewpoints of depicted characters or that of an active narrator. How unsophisticated and innocent it must seem to those acquainted with the “neutrality” of bourgeois fiction, which deviates from the viewpoint of the bourgeoisie only to relate the views of a character—who naturally lives in a different world.</p>

        <p>I wish that <a href="https://www.jonmsterling.com/jms-014S/">Things.app</a> made it possible for me to mark that a task is in progress. There is something about the ability to do this that fits well with my own need to lower the mental and spiritual weight of my pile of tasks.</p>
