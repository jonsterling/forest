\p{[#{\KaTeX}](https://katex.org/) has a very rudimentary support for commutative diagrams built-in, by emulating the \code{\startverb amscd\stopverb} package. Unfortunately, this support is completely inadequate for usage by mathematicians today:}
\ol{
  \li{\strong{Only square diagram shapes are supported:} commutative diagrams in general have diagonal and curved lines, but these are not supported.}
  \li{\strong{The rendering of the limited gamut of supported commutative diagrams is broken} in most browsers (at least Safari and Firefox). In particular, lines are jagged as they are pieced together from pipes and arrows that are subtly misaligned.}
