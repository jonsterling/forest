\p{In practice, we will frequently consider \em{vertical} displayed functors between fibrations over the same base category #{B}, i.e. [functors displayed](jms-005I) over the identity functor \Mor{\Idn{B}}{B}{B}. Likewise, we will often consider vertical natural transformations between vertical functors, i.e. [natural transformations](jms-005K) whose components are vertical. The vertical and non-vertical perspectives give rise to two different (very large) displayed categories of displayed categories, one with unfixed base, and the other with a fixed base. Both viewpoints are important, but it is important not to get them confused.}
