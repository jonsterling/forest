\p{Here I compile some of the lessons that I have synthesized from the experience of writing the [foundations of relative category theory](frct-003I) in hypertext, and my subsequent investigations into the concept of [evergreen notes](tfmt-0003). As it was my first attempt to develop transformative hypertext media, I believe I made some mistakes.}
