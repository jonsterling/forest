\p{If a sequence #{\Sequence{A}{f}{B}{g}{C}} in an abelian category is [exact](jms-0002) at #{B}, then it is [complex](jms-0002).}

\proof{
  \p{By exactness at #{B} we may assume #{\Ker{g}=\Img{f}}; we must show that #{f;g=0}. Based on our assumption, we see that #{f;g} factors through the zero morphism as follows:}

  \tex{
    \begin{tikzpicture}[diagram]
      \node (A) {$A$};
      \node[right = of A] (ker/g) {$\Ker{g}$};
      \node[right = of ker/g] (B) {$B$};
      \node[right = of B] (C) {$C$};
      \draw[->>] (A) to (ker/g);
      \draw[>->] (ker/g) to (B);
      \draw[->] (B) to node[below] {$g$} (C);
      \draw[->,bend right=30] (A) to node[below] {$f$} (B);
      \draw[->, bend left=30] (ker/g) to node[above] {$0$} (C);
    \end{tikzpicture}
  }

  \p{Any morphism factoring through zero must be zero.}
}
