\p{This is an investigation of Guillaume Munch-Maccagnoniâ€™s [theory of duploids](munch-2014), working in the setting of [univalent foundations](jms-0046). Most of what we do could be done in non-univalent foundations; the purpose of univalence is to sharpen our perspective on the relationship between structure and property in duploid theory.}
