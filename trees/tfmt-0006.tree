\p{Multiple hierarchical structures can be imposed on the same associative network of nodes; a hierarchical structure amounts to a “narrative” that contextualizes a given subgraph of the network. One example could be the construction of lecture notes; another example could be a homework sheet; a further example could be a book chapter or scientific article. Although these may draw from the same body of definitions, theorems, examples, and exercises, these objects are contextualized within a different narrative, often toward fundamentally different ends.}

\p{As a result, any interface for navigating the neighbor-relation in hierarchically organized notes would need to take account of the multiplicity of parent nodes. Most hypertext tools assume that the position of a node in the hierarchy is unique, and therefore have a single “next/previous” navigation interface; we must investigate the design of interfaces that surface all parent/neighbor relations.}
