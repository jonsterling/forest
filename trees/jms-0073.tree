\title{namespaces and addresses in a [forest](tfmt-000R)}
\date{2023-08-14}
\author{jonmsterling}

\p{A \tree in \Forester is associated to an address of the form \code{xxx-NNNN} where \code{xxx} is \em{your} chosen “namespace” (most likely your initials) and \code{NNNN} is a four-digit [base-36 number](jms-0074). The purpose of the namespace and the [base-36](jms-0074) code is to uniquely identify a \tree, not only within your \forest but across all \forests. A tree with address \code{xxx-NNNN} is always stored in a file named \code{xxx-NNNN.tree}.}

\p{Note that the format of \tree addresses is purely a matter of convention, and is not forced by the \Forester tool. Users are free to use their own format for tree addresses, and in some cases alternative (human-readable) formats may be desirable: this includes trees representing bibliographic references, as well as biographical trees.}
