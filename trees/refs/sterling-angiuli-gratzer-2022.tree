\p{We present XTT, a version of Cartesian cubical type theory specialized for Bishop sets Ã  la [Coquand](thierrycoquand), in which every type enjoys a definitional version of the uniqueness of identity proofs. Using cubical notions, XTT reconstructs many of the ideas underlying Observational Type Theory, a version of intensional type theory that supports function extensionality. We prove the canonicity property of XTT (that every closed boolean is definitionally equal to a constant) by Artin gluing.}
