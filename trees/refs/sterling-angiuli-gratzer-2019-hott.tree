\p{We contribute XTT, a cubical reconstruction of Observational Type Theory which extends intensional type theory with a dependent equality type that enjoys function extensionality and judgmental unicity of identity proofs. XTT employs a variant of the Cartesian cubical Kan operations satisfying regularity (i.e., transport in constant type families is judgmentally constant), allowing its equality type to model Martin-Lofâ€™s identity type judgmentally. We prove canonicity for the initial model of XTT (i.e., any closed term of boolean type is equal to either true or false) using a novel cubical extension (independently proposed by [Awodey](steveawodey)) of the categorical gluing technique inspired by [Coquand](thierrycoquand) and [Shulman](mikeshulman), in which we glue the fundamental fibration of a category of augmented Cartesian cubical sets along a cubical nerve. We conjecture that our methods will extend to open terms, allowing us to establish normalization and decidability of the typing relation.}
