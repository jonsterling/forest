\p{Many non-LaTeX hypertext tools boast some compatibility with mathematical typesetting: for instance, in any HTML-based tool it is possible to use MathML or, for better cross-browser support and easier authoring, import [#{\KaTeX}](https://katex.org/) or [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/). For instance: [Logseq](https://logseq.com/), [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), and [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) all support rendering of LaTeX math code using either #{\KaTeX} or MathJax. \strong{Unfortunately, the “support” provided is so limited that it is not usable for a working mathematician — so it is somewhat puzzling why the support is present in the first place.} Here we will discuss some fundamental requirements for any tool that aims to support mathematical notes, without which it is not applicable for use by professionals.}
