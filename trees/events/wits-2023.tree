\p{The Second Workshop on the Implementation of Type Systems (WITS 2023) will be held on August 28, 2023, in Braga, Portugal, co-located with IFL 2023. The goal of this workshop is to bring together the implementors of a variety of languages with advanced type systems. The main focus is on the practical issues that come up in the implementation of these systems, rather than the theoretical frameworks that underlie them. In particular, we want to encourage exchanging ideas between the communities around specific systems that would otherwise be accessible to only a very select group. The workshop will have a mix of invited and contributed talks, organized discussion times, and informal collaboration time. We invite participants to share their experiences, study differences among the implementations, and generalize lessons from those. We also want to promote the creation of a shared vocabulary and set of best practices for implementing type systems.}
