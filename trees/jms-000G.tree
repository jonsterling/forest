\p{A [monoidal category](jms-000D) is nothing more than a [bicategory](jms-000E) with only a single object; to be more precise, given a such a [bicategory](jms-000E) #{B} with just one object #{\bullet\in B}, the hom category #{\Hom{B}{\bullet}{\bullet}} is monoidal, with the tensor product given by horizontal composition, the tensor unit given by the horizontal identity, and unitors and associators given by those of #{B}.}
