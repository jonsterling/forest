\p{This [dissertation](sterling-2021-thesis) positively resolves the [decidability conjecture](jms-000T) for cubical type theory, the last remaining open question in its syntactic metatheory. Standard techniques proved inadequate for tackling this problem, so the bulk of this dissertation focuses on developing a new mathematical technique called \strong{synthetic Tait computability} that generalizes and abstracts the method of \em{Tait computability} or \em{logical predicates}; in the past two years, synthetic Tait computability has played a central role in solving several problems in both type theory and core programming languages, suggesting that this dissertation presents a lasting and transformative contribution to the state of the art.}
