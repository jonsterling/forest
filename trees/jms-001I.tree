\p{No two authors use the same definition of [created limit](jms-001H). One issue is strictness (old-fashioned definitions are overly strict and refer to equality of objects), but there also appear to be a number of variations with differences of a more substantive nature. My advice is to always check what definition some result is using before trusting it or reusing it, because this is an easy way to sneak an enormous mistake into your work.}
