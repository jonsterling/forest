\p{Conversely to [the closure of a class of sets under change of base](frct-002M), we may take a class of \em{families} of sets #{\mathfrak{F}} to the the class of sets #{\mathfrak{F}\Sub{1}\subseteq{\mathscr{M}}} spanned by sets #{S} such that the singleton family #{\brc{S}} lies in #{\mathfrak{C}}.}
