\p{Let #{i\sqsubseteq j} in a [pointed](jms-001S) dcpo #{A} such that #{i} is [positive](jms-001M); then #{j} is [positive](jms-001M).}

\proof{
  \p{Fixing semidirected #{J\subseteq A} such that #{j\sqsubseteq \bigsqcup{J}}, we must show that #{J} is inhabited. This follows from our assumption that #{i} is positive becuase #{i\sqsubseteq j\sqsubseteq \bigsqcup{J}}.}
