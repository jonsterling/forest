\p{Today when synthetic methods are employed, it is usually with the intention of proving something about a concrete (analytically constituted) object. For instance, [synthetic differential geometry](kock-2006) is used to prove things about actual smooth manifolds; synthetic domain theory [can be used](fiore-plotkin-1997) to prove things about actual #{\omega}-cpos. Likewise, [synthetic Tait computability](sterling-2021-thesis) can be used to prove things about the actual syntax of actual programming languages!}
