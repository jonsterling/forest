\p{This chapter situates the motivations and applications of type theory in mathematics and computer science, and poses these against the semantic and syntactic properties of type theory that are needed to substantiate these applications. On the semantic side, type theory needs a number of properties including function extensionality, function comprehension, propositional univalence, effective quotients, etc.; on the syntactic side, type theory needs to be at least consistent, and many applications require both canonicity and decidability. Combining these syntactic and semantic properties into a single system has been a challenge, and cubical type theory was designed with the intention of satisfying them all. Prior to this dissertation, only the decidability conjecture remained open; thus with the present contribution, we regard the \em{Cubical Hypothesis} confirmed.}
