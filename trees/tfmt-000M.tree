\p{The [W3C MathML Core Working Draft](https://www.w3.org/TR/mathml-core/) points out that MathML can be embedded into \code{\startverb<svg>\stopverb} elements using the \code{\startverb<foreignObject>\stopverb} element. This is a great strength of the modularity of the model, and I believe that in the future, we will be able to use this as a way to render accessible mathematical diagrams in hypertext.}

\p{What is missing? Essentially the current issue preventing widespread use of this method is the fact that neither SVG nor MathML is an authoring language: they are [both](tfmt-000N) [currently too low-level](tfmt-000O) to be seriously used by authors.}

\p{For exactly so long as diagrams must be drawn using LaTeX-based tools rather than something MathML-compatible, it would be non-negotiable for the support of notational macros to itself be based in LaTeX syntax (e.g. as in both #{\KaTeX} and MathJax). But it is worth imagining a future in which mathematical diagrams are drawn using a high-level interface to SVG, and then a pure MathML approach to notational macros becomes quite viable. This is not currently the world we live in, but it is something to hope for.}
