\p{Up to equivalence of categories, we may detect global smallness of a category #{C} from the perspective of the [family fibration](frct-0006) #{\FAM{C}}. In particular, a category is equivalent to a globally small category when its family fibration has a \em{generic object} in the following sense.}
