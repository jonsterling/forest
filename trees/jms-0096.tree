\p{It depends. For example, if you did a four year Bachelor degree with a research component in the final year (such as a high quality honors thesis), this could be similar in some respects to doing an undergraduate at Cambridge followed by an MPhil. In the end, having or not having a Masters degree is not going to be the thing that convinces \em{me} that you should do a PhD; on the other hand, it can help with your application for admission and funding â€” a side of the process that I am not in control of.}

\p{I have been informed by my colleague [[petersewell]] that for students with untraditional backgrounds, many things become possible if your supervisor has external funding that can be used for students. I do not currently have this kind of funding, but there may be possibilities in the future. Please write to me if you would like to discuss this.}
