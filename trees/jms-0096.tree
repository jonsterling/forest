\p{  
  Unfortunately such an application is unlikely to be successful. Our PhD program lasts only three years, and so a student without a Mastersâ€™ degree will find it difficult to be admitted and, if they are admitted, to carry out a successful PhD in such a short time. I am not happy with this aspect of our program because I think it places barriers in front of people who could become successful researchers, but I am not in control of this.
