\p{This chapter develops a more sophisticated application of synthetic Tait computability, the proof of normalization and decidability of Martin-Löf’s type theory with a cumulative hierarchy of universes. The synthetic argument contained in this chapter builds on the work of [Fiore](fiore-2002) on categorical normalization by gluing for simply typed λ-calculus, and that of [Coquand](coquand-2019) on a presheaf-theoretic version of normalization by evaluation for dependent types. Analogous to the external argument of [Fiore](fiore-2002), we construe the syntax of normal and neutral forms as the initial algebra for an internal inductive definition in the language of synthetic Tait computability. The influence of [Coquand](coquand-2019) is visible in the definition of the \em{Tait saturation yoga} for dependent types in the synthetic setting, an important closure condition for logical predicates that comprised one of the main innovations of [Tait](tait-1967) in the context of simply typed combinators. Although this chapter is intended only as “dry run” for the main result (to be exposed in [Chapter 7](jms-0014)), the normalization argument presented here has intrinsic value: it is the simplest and most direct proof of normalization and decidability for Martin-Löf type theory with #{\eta}-laws and cumulative universes that has appeared in the literature so far.}
