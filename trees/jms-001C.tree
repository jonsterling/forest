\p{Finally, an application of synthetic Tait computability to \em{security} and \em{information flow control} is identified: a security class is a phase distinction between low and high security. The preliminary results presented in this section have been substantially improved upon by [Sterling and Harper](sterling-harper-2022), adding support for general recursion and termination-insensitive noninterference by combining synthetic Tait computability with [synthetic domain theory](hyland-1991).}
