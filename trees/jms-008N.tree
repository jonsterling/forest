\p{Central to both the design of programming languages and the practice of software engineering is the tension between \strong{abstraction} and \strong{composition}. I employ semantic methods from category theory and type theory to design, verify, and implement languages that enable both programmers and mathematicians to negotiate the different levels of abstraction that arise in their work. I apply my research to global safety and security properties of programming languages as well as the design and implementation of interactive theorem provers for higher-dimensional mathematics. I develop foundational and practical mathematical tools to deftly weave together verifications that cut across multiple levels of abstraction.}
