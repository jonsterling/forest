\p{Like [#{\KaTeX}](tfmt-000J), [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) supports the \code{\startverb amscd\stopverb} commands for rudimentary square-shaped commutative diagrams. Unlike the [#{\KaTeX} implementation](tfmt-000J) of \code{\startverb amscd\stopverb}, the supported diagrams are rendered correctly without jagged lines; this means that for the vanishingly small population of mathematicians whose needs are limited to square-shaped diagrams, MathJaxâ€™s builtin support is viable.}

\p{On the other hand, there is a more advanced option available for users of MathJax: the [XyJax-v3 plugin](https://github.com/sonoisa/XyJax-v3), which adds support for the full gamut of \code{\startverb xypic\stopverb} diagrams to MathJax. Notably, this plugin is used by the [Stacks Project](stacks-project). The only downside of the \code{\startverb xypic\stopverb} support is that it interacts poorly with accessibility features (but no worse than any other solution to rendering non-trivial commutative diagrams), and diagrams created using \code{\startverb xypic\stopverb} look considerably less professional than those created using \code{\startverb tikz\stopverb} or [quiver](tfmt-000I).}
