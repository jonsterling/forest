\p{Type abstraction, the phase distinction, and computational effects all play an important role in the design and implementation of ML-style module systems. We propose a simple type theoretic metalanguage \strong{Ï†ML} for multi-phase modularity in which these concepts are treated individually, supporting the definition of high-level modular constructs such as generative and applicative functors, as well as all extant forms of structure sharing.}
