\p{I have gathered the scripts to convert [Bike](jms-0085) outlines into Markdown via idiomatic HTML in a [Git repository](https://git.sr.ht/~jonsterling/bike-convertors) where they can be easily downloaded. If you have any improvements to these scripts, please [submit them as a patch](https://git-send-email.io/) to my [public inbox](https://lists.sr.ht/~jonsterling/public-inbox)! I am also interested in whether it is possible to write the [XSLT 2.0 stylesheet](jms-0087) as equivalent XSLT 1.0, to avoid [requiring](jms-008E) the proprietary [Saxon](https://saxonica.com/welcome/welcome.xml) tool. Feel free also to send comments on this post to my public inbox, or discuss with me on [Mastodon](https://mathstodon.xyz/@jonmsterling).}
