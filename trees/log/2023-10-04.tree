\p{Started to work on proving the “dream initial algebra theorem” in [[jms-009S]]; managed to bang out the structure identity principle for homomorphisms of #{F}-algebras. I have almost defined the wild category of #{F}-algebras; I needed to include data in the “endofunctor” witnessing preservation of unitors and associators.}

\p{First Wednesday Meeting at the [[camcl]].}
