\p{Meeting of new faculty with head of department [[alastairberesford]].}

\p{Working on revision of [[sterling-2022-existentials]]. I am also thinking about whether it would be worth writing a paper about the tensor products of pointed dcpos in [constructive domain theory](jms-001E). My concern is the constructive cocompleteness of the category of dcpos remains slightly vague â€” this is claimed in variuos places, and it is very likely that the results of [[jung-moshier-vickers-2008]] are constructive.}
