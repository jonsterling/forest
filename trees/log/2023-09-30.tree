\p{Today I finished my [Agda formalization](https://github.com/martinescardo/TypeTopology/pull/199) in [[typetopology]] of the wild-categorical results that [[mikeshulman]] and I were hoping for in regard to [[jms-009S]]. Then I translated these proofs into English. I started trying to re-deduce [[jms-004H]] in this style, but noticed that there may be an issue: in the old proof, we split a very specific [quasi-idempotent](jms-003M), but here I am trying to split them all. I wrote to [[mikeshulman]] mentioning this to him.}
