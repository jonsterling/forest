\p{In regard to [[jms-009S]], [[mikeshulman]] answered my question from [yesterday](2023-09-30): apparently we can nonetheless split arbitrary quasi-idempotents in the wild category of #{A}-algebras, and this makes essential use of the second component of the homotopy #{\Con{happly}\,Q_0\colon m \circ m \sim m}. It is really fascinating that the [splitting](jms-0044) that I constructed last time worked differently and seemed to take advantage of the specific cone involved; this clarity is a really nice consequence of [Mike](mikeshulman)â€™s preference to focus on the more general result.}
