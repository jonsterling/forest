\p{Working on [[jms-00A5]] and noticed that the [Phoa](wesleyphoa) principle seems to hold in 2-categorical generality, when you phrase it in terms of an interaction between cartesian closed structure, cocomma objects, and comma objects. It is easy to prove in the case of locally posetal 2-categories, but I believe it will also be true in general. This could be another paper, maybe one that a student could work on with me; a lot of string diagrams would be needed.}
