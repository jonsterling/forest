\p{[[mikeshulman]] has sent me a potential proof of [quasi-idempotence](jms-003M) for the generic element of a [semicoherent cone](jms-003H), in our [[jms-009S]] project. This relies on a “fattened” definition of semicoherence in the wild-categorical setting, similar to Mike’s [fattened version](jms-003W) in the special case of subuniverses. [Mike](mikeshulman) points out that the condition, when specialized for cones over the identity functor, is much simpler than the general case. I am thinking that I might see if it is possible to formalize it in [[typetopology]].}
