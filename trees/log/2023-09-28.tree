\p{I have added an informal [job posting](jms-009R) to my home page in regard to the newly awarded [[jms-008K]] grant. I have also sent my final revision of [[sterling-2023-grothendieck]] to the editor of the [[chapman-grothendieck-2022]] proceedings.}

\p{I received all my new office equipment and have mostly set it up; will bring a mechanical keyboard from home [tomorrow](2023-09-29). I am using the new equipment to give my [topos colloquium](sterling-2023-topos-colloquium).}
