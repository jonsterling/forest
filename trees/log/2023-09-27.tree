\p{My goals for today are to put the finishing touches on my [[toposinstitute]] [colloquium talk](sterling-2023-topos-colloquium) for tomorrow, and to finish my pass through [[sterling-2023-grothendieck]].}

\p{Today I added an experimental \code{\startverb\iftex\stopverb} command to [Forester](jms-005P) in response to [[vikramanchoudhury]]â€™s post to the mailing list. If this command solves his problem, then I should add it to the changelog.}
