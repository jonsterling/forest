\p{Cubical type theory is an extension of Martin-Löf type theory recently proposed by [Cohen, Coquand, Mörtberg, and the author](cchm-2017) which allows for direct manipulation of n-dimensional cubes and where Voevodsky’s Univalence Axiom is provable. In this paper we prove canonicity for cubical type theory: any natural number in a context build from only name variables is judgmentally equal to a numeral. To achieve this we formulate a typed and deterministic operational semantics and employ a computability argument adapted to a presheaf-like setting.}
