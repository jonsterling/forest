\p{Had a very interesting chat with [[nathancorbyn]] and [[marcelofiore]] this afternoon. [[nathancorbyn]] described his work on normalization-by-evaluation in gluing style, which he has formalized computationally in Agda via setoids. [[nathancorbyn]] aims to capture TDPE in a principled way, including the [Futamura projections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_evaluation)(!); [[marcelofiore]] is suggesting that we start from the free extension of #{\lambda}-calculus by a model of a given algebraic theory (which I think we basically understand), and try to move from this to handling second-order algebraic theories. We will come back to this [tomorrow](2023-10-06).}
