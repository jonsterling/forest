\p{Separately from my day-job at University of Cambridge, I am independently researching [tools for scientific thought](tfmt-0001) and developing software like [Forester](jms-005P) that you can use to unlock your brain. \mark{If you have benefited from this work or the writings on my [blog](jms-007W), please considering supporting me with a [sponsorship on Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/jonmsterling).}}
