\p{In classical category theory, cartesian fibrations are defined by
  [Grothendieck](sga-1) to be certain functors #{E\to B} such that any morphism #{f:x\to Pv}
in #{B} lies strictly underneath a cartesian morphism in #{E}. As we have
discussed, this condition cannot be formulated unless equality is meaningful
for the collection of objects of #{B}.}

\p{There is an alternative definition of cartesian fibration due to [Street](street-1980) that avoids
equality of objects; here we require for each #{f:x\to Pv} a cartesian morphism
#{h:\InvImg{f}v \to v} together with an isomorphism #{\phi : P(\InvImg{f}v)\cong x}
such that #{\phi^{-1};Ph = f}.}

\p{By unrolling definitions, it is not difficult to see that the displayed
category #{P\Sub{\bullet}} is a cartesian fibration in our sense if and only if the functor
#{P:E\to B} was a fibration in Streetâ€™s sense. Moreover, it can be seen that the
Grothendieck construction yields a \em{Grothendieck} fibration
#{\TotCat{P\Sub{\bullet}}\to B}; hence we have introduced by accident a convenient
destription of the \em{strictification} of Street fibrations into equivalent
Grothendieck fibrations.}
