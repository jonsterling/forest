\p{It is easy to make the mistake of prematurely imposing a complex hierarchical structure on a network of notes, which leads to excessive refactoring. Hierarchy should be used sparingly, and its strength is for the large-scale organization of ideas. The best structure to impose on a network of many small related ideas is a relatively flat one. I believe that this is one of the mistakes made in the writing of the [foundations of relative category theory](frct-003I), whose hierarchical nesting was too complex and quite beholden to my experience with pre-hypertext media.}
