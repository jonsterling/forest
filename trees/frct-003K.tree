\title{cartesian closure of the meta-category of all categories}

\p{Consequently there exists a meta-category #{\BoldSymbol{\mathfrak{Cat}}} of all categories. Following [Lawvere](http://rfcwalters.blogspot.com/2010/10/old-post-why-are-we-concerned-fw.html) (but deviating from some other authors that ground the notion of meta-categories in \em{classes}) we notice that #{\BoldSymbol{\mathfrak{Cat}}} is cartesian closed; in other words, all functor categories exist regardless of size.}

\p{\strong{Assumption.} At times we may assume that there exists a \em{category} #{\SET\subseteq\BoldSymbol{\mathfrak{Coll}}} of collections that we will refer to as sets, such that #{\SET} is closed under the axioms of [ETCS](lawvere-1964-etcs). Rather than work with #{\SET} at all times, our approach is to use the tools of relative category theory to objectify the notions of “small” and “locally small” category over any category #{B}, generalizing the role of #{\SET} from classical category theory.}
