\p{Each tree generates an RSS feed containing its immediate children; if a tree is located at \code{xxx-NNNN.xml}, then the corresponding RSS file will be located at \code{xxx-NNNN.rss.xml}. Currently no content is placed in the RSS feed items, but in the future we may add some best-effort plain text linearization of the first paragraph of the tree or something. [Feedback on this feature is welcome](https://lists.sr.ht/~jonsterling/forester-discuss).}
