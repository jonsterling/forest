\p{There are a few LaTeX packages that implement relative hierarchy for sectioning as an alternative to the [backward model of absolute hierarchy](tfmt-000B).}
\ul{
  \li{The [coseoul](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/coseoul?lang=en) package implements relative sectioning commands; similar to the existing sectioning commands, an [implicit hierarchy](tfmt-000D) model is employed, leading to an imperative feel with commands like \code{\startverb\levelup{<title>}\stopverb} and \code{\startverb\leveldown{<title>}\stopverb}.}
  
  \li{The [modular](https://ctan.org/pkg/modular?lang=en) package builds on [coseoul](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/coseoul?lang=en) to behave better under the \em{transclusion} of LaTeX documents, introducing a \code{\startverb\subimport\stopverb} command that is to be used instead of \code{\startverb\input\stopverb} or \code{\startverb\include\stopverb}.}
  
  \li{On the other hand, the [dieudonne](https://github.com/jonsterling/latex-dieudonne) package implements a form of relative sectioning with an [explicit hierarchical model](tfmt-000D), i.e. one in which the syntactical nesting of LaTeX environments induces the hierarchy.}

\p{There are some attempts to impose a ([relative](tfmt-000B), [explicit](tfmt-000D)) hierarchical model in HTML by using \code{\startverb<section>\stopverb} and \strong{only} the \code{\startverb<h1>\stopverb} heading command. In the HTML5 spec, this behavior was initially endorsed as part of the “outline” algorithm, but unfortunately [almost no vendors of browsers nor assistive technology have correctly implemented this behavior](https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/83/).}
