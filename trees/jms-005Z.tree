\p{A serious (and as-yet unfixed) problem was discovered in July of 2023 by [[yueniu]], which undermines the proof of adequacy given; in particular, the proof that the logical relation on free algebras is admissible is not correct. I believe there is a different proof of adequacy for the calculus described, but it will have a different structure from what currently appears in the paper. We thank [[yueniu]] for his attention to detail and careful reading of this paper.}
