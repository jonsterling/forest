\p{Much of this dissertation is stated and proved by exploiting the language of (Grothendieck) topoi, a concept that leads a dual life as a kind of generalized logic \em{and} as a kind of generalized topology. The viewpoint of topos theory \em{qua} generalized topology plays an important role in this dissertation, and yet it nonetheless remains unfamiliar to most computer scientists and logicians. For this reason, Chapter 2 is provided as sufficient exposition to understand the use of topoi in the remainder of the dissertation, focusing on the \em{recollement} or \em{gluing} of a topos from a pair of complementary open and closed subtopoi, a classical construction that provides the geometrical basis for synthetic Tait computability.}
