\p{In our [meeting](jms-008Q) [yesterday](2023-09-11), [Marcelo](marcelofiore) pointed out that the generic object #{V} of the object classifier has a very interesting property: the map #{V+1\to V^V} sending the left side to the constant map and the right side to the identity map is an isomorphism. I conjectured that this can be deduced from \em{synthetic quasicoherence} in the sense of [Blechschmidt](blechschmidt-2023-qcoh), which is a generalization of the Kockâ€“Lawvere axiom from synthetic differential geometry to arbitrary geometric theories. I have now stated and proved this statement precisely. First we recall the [synthetic quasicoherence theorem](jms-008T) of [Blechschmidt](blechschmidt-2023-qcoh):}

\p{From the above, the desired result follows immediately.}
