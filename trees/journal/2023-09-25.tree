\p{I received a brief and positive referee report my contribution [[sterling-2023-grothendieck]] to the post-proceedings of the [[chapman-grothendieck-2022]], which raised an interesting question: to what degree was [[permartinlöf]] in fact aware of [Grothendieck](alexandergrothendieck)’s universes? In any case, I think I should be a bit more precise about the attributions here, and naturally it would be appropriate to mention Zermelo’s priority as well. I should also remember to fix the typographical error found by [[marcelofiore]].}
