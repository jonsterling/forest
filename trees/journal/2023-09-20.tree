\p{I have been thinking about monoidal closed structures induced by [slicing over a monad](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/229358/non-cartesian-monoidal-model-structure-on-a-slice-category/229371#229371), which has been considered by [Combette and Munch](combette-munch-2018) as a potential denotational semantics of destructors à la C++. It occurred to me that this construction is, in fact, essentially a degenerate case of Day convolution on an internal monoidal category — and this made me realize that there might be a nice way to understand Day convolution in the language of [fibered categories](frct-003I). In fact, these results are probably a special case of Theorem 11.22 of [Shulman’s paper on enriched indexed categories](shulman-2013).}
