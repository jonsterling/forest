\p{Some authors including [Grothendieck](sga-1) give an equivalent definition of cartesian fibration that factors through a \em{nonequivalent} definition of cartesian morphisms. Such authors refer to our notion of [cartesian morphism](frct-0001) as “hypercartesian” (see [Streicher](streicher-fcjb)).}
