\p{We always prefer our notation to reflect the \em{diagrammatic} order of composition rather than the applicative order, since the latter disrupts geometric intuitions. As a result, what we have called the “left and right” unitors respectively in our [definition of bicategories](jms-000E) are inverted from the definitions one finds in many other texts.}
