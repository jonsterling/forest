\p{By the contractibility of singletons and our [characterization of paths between homomorphisms](jms-003Y), the definition of [semicoherence structures](jms-003W) is equivalent to following more direct formulation that avoids the additional cell #{\phi}:}

##{  \Prod{\brc{X,Y,Z:\Comma{A}{\UU}}}
\Prod{f : X\multimap Y}
\Prod{g : Y\multimap Z}
\Con{ap}\Sub{g} \prn{\vartheta\Sub{u} f} \bullet \vartheta\Sub{u} g
= \vartheta\Sub{u} \prn{f;g}
}


\p{Our reason for choosing the more complex definition involving #{\prn{h,\phi}} is that the extra flexibility comes in handy in our results, as suggested by [Michael Shulman](mikeshulman) in private communication.}
