\p{I discussed with [Marcelo](marcelofiore) the definition of single-variable substitution in the object classifier using the tininess of the interval. I plan to try and define this in Agda-flat; I am curious if I can get it to compute, using rewrite rules for the “amazing” transpose.}

\p{We also discussed the plan for the [Discrete Mathematics](jms-0081) course. My lectures should start somewhere in the set theory section, and then continue through regular languages and automata to the end.}
