\p{In many cases, one starts with a functor #{P:E\to B}; if it were meaningful to
speak of \em{equality} of objects in an arbitrary category then there would be an
obvious construction of a displayed category #{P\Sub{\bullet}} from #{P}; we would
simply set #{P\Sub{x}} to be the collection of objects #{u\in E} such that #{Pu=x}. As
it stands there is a more subtle version that will coincide up to categorical
equivalence with the naïve one in all cases that the latter is meaningful.}

\ol{
  \li{
    We define an object of #{P\Sub{x}} to be a pair #{(u,\phi\Sub{u})} where #{u\in E} and
  #{\phi\Sub{u} : Pu\cong x}. It is good to visualize such a pair as a “crooked
  leg” like so:
    \tex{
      \begin{tikzpicture}[diagram]
        \node (u) {$u$};
        \node (Pu) [below = 1cm of u] {$Pu$};
        \node (x) [right = 1.5cm of Pu] {$x$};
        \draw[lies over] (u) to (Pu);
        \draw[->] (Pu) to node [below] {$\phi\Sub{u}$} (x);
      \end{tikzpicture}
    }
  }

  \li{
    A morphism #{(u,\phi\Sub{u})\DispTo{f} (v,\phi\Sub{v})} over #{f : x \to y} is given by
  a morphism #{h : u\to v} that lies over #{f} modulo the isomorphisms
  #{\phi\Sub{u},\phi\Sub{v}} in sense depicted below:


    \tex{
      \begin{tikzpicture}[diagram]
        \node (pu) {$Pu$};
        \node (pv) [right = of pu] {$Pv$};
        \node (x) [below left = 1.5cm of pu] {$x$};
        \node (y) [below right = 1.5cm of pv] {$y$};
        \node (u) [above = 1.5cm of pu] {$u$};
        \node (v) [above = 1.5cm of pv] {$v$};
        \draw[lies over] (u) to (pu);
        \draw[lies over] (v) to (pv);
        \draw[->] (u) to node [above] {$h$} (v);
        \draw[->] (x) to node [sloped,above] {$\phi\Sub{u}\Sup{-1}$} (pu);
        \draw[->] (pu) to node [upright desc] {$Ph$} (pv);
        \draw[->] (pv) to node [sloped,above] {$\phi\Sub{v}$} (y);
        \draw[->,bend right=30] (x) to node [below] {$f$} (y);
      \end{tikzpicture}
    }
  }
}

\p{We have a functor #{\TotCat{P\Sub{\bullet}}\to E} taking a pair #{(x,(u,\phi\Sub{u}))} to #{u}.}
