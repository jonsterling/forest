\p{Met with [[foscoloregian]] and [[danielepalombi]] on [[jms-009V]]. [[foscoloregian]] suggested that the immediate goal is to find a proper universal property for the [Munch–Maccagnoni’s duploid construction](munch-2014) as some kind of gluing or pushout, as it looks tantalizingly similar to a collage — it is \em{almost} the collage of the profunctor of a given adjunction, except that in the place where you usually have no morphisms, there are morphisms.}

\p{The obvious obstruction to a category-theoretic universal property is that it starts with categories and yields a non-category except in degenerate cases, but the idea of [[foscoloregian]] is that we might consider a duploid-theoretic universal property! As a category is a degenerate kind of duploid, we might consider the duploid construction as in fact happening in the category of duploids. This is not entirely nonsense, as duploids are models of an essentially algebraic theory and so can in principle be glued together.}

\p{[[foscoloregian]] has tried some naïve possibilities for such a gluing — but so far these have not worked. We concluded that we need to have a [“shut up and calculate” meeting](jms-00A2) in order to actually come up with a conjecture as to what the gluing needs to be. We have set this meeting for [[2023-10-05]].}
