\p{Let #{\mathfrak{C}\subseteq\mathscr{M}} be a class of sets; there exists a class #{\bar{\mathfrak{C}}} of \em{families}
of sets that contains #{\prn{S\Sub{i}}\Sub{i\in I}} exactly when each
#{S\Sub{i}} lies in #{\mathfrak{C}}. We will refer to #{\bar{\mathfrak{C}}} as the \em{closure under base change} of #{\mathfrak{C}}, a name motivated by the fact that when #{\prn{S\Sub{i}}\Sub{i\in I}} lies in #{\bar{\mathfrak{C}}},
then for any #{u:J\to I}, the base change #{\prn{S\Sub{uj}}\Sub{j\in J}} also lies in #{\bar{\mathfrak{C}}}.}
