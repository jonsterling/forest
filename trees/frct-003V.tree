\p{The [family fibration](frct-0006) can be [cloven](frct-003T), constructively. In particular, let #{C} be a category and consider the [family fibration](frct-0006) #{\FAM{C}} over #{\SET}; let #{\Mor{f}{T}{S}} be a function between sets and let #{u\in C^S} be an #{S}-indexed family of objects of #{C}. The family #{\InvImg{f}u = f;u\in C^T} is the object part of a cartesian lift for #{u} along #{f}. The [cartesian morphism](frct-0001) #{\DispMor{\bar{f}}{f}{\InvImg{f}u}{u}\in\FAM{C}} is given by the identity map #{\Mor{\Idn{\InvImg{f}u}}{\InvImg{f}u}{\InvImg{f}u}\in C^T}.}
