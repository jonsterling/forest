\p{Let #{E} be displayed over #{B}. Then #{E} is a [cartesian fibration](frct-0002) if and only if the following two conditions hold:}

\ol{
  \li{\em{Hypocartesian lifts.} For each #{f:x\to y\in B} and #{\bar{y}\in E\Sub{y}} there exists a displayed object #{\bar{x}\in E\Sub{x}} and hypocartesian morphism #{\bar{f}:\bar{x}\DispTo{f}\bar{y}}.}
  
  \li{\em{Closure under composition.} If #{\bar{f}:\bar{x}\DispTo{f}\bar{y}} and #{\bar{g}:\bar{y}\DispTo{g}\bar{z}} are hypocartesian, then #{\bar{f};\bar{g}} is hypocartesian.}
}


\proof{
  \p{Suppose first that #{E} is a cartesian fibration in our sense. Then
  #{E} has hypocartesian lifts because it has cartesian lifts. For closure under composition, fix hypocartesian #{\bar{f},\bar{g}}; because [hypocartesian and cartesian maps coincide in a cartesian fibration](frct-002C) we know that #{\bar{f},\bar{g}} are also cartesian and hence by the [generalized pullback lemma](frct-001H) so is the composite #{\bar{f};\bar{g}}; therefore it follows that #{\bar{f};\bar{g}} is also hypocartesian.}

  \p{Conversely, suppose that #{E} is a cartesian fibration in the sense of Grothendieck, and let #{\bar{f}:\bar{x}\DispTo{f}\bar{y}} be the hypocartesian lift of #{f:x\to y} at #{\bar{y}\in E\Sub{y}}; we shall see that #{\bar{f}} is also a \em{cartesian} lift of #{f} at #{\bar{y}} by constructing a unique factorization as follows:}

  \p{Let #{\bar{m}:\bar{u}\tick\DispTo{m}\bar{x}} be the hypocartesian lift of #{m} at #{\bar{x}}, where #{\bar{u}\tick\in E\Sub{u}}. By hypothesis, the composite #{\bar{m};\bar{f} : \bar{u}\tick\DispTo{m;f}\bar{y}} is hypocartesian, so #{\bar{h}} factors uniquely through #{\bar{m};\bar{f}} over #{\Idn{u}}:}

  \tex{
    \begin{tikzpicture}[diagram]
      \SpliceDiagramSquare{
        west/style = lies over,
        east/style = lies over,
        north/node/style = upright desc,
        height = 1.5cm,
        nw = \bar{u}',
        ne = \bar{y},
        sw = u,
        north = \bar{m};\bar{f},
        south = m;f,
        se = y,
      }
      \node (u') [above left = 1.5cm of nw,xshift=-.5cm] {$\bar{u}$};
      \node (u) [above left = 1.5cm of sw,xshift=-.5cm] {$u$};
      \draw[lies over] (u') to (u);
      \draw[->,bend left=30] (u') to node [sloped,above] {$\bar{h}$} (ne);
      \draw[double] (u) to (sw);
      \draw[->,exists] (u') to node [desc] {$i$} (nw);
    \end{tikzpicture}
  }

  \p{The composite #{i;\bar{m} : \bar{u}\DispTo{m}\bar{x}} is the required (cartesian) factorization of #{\bar{h}} through #{\bar{f}} over #{m}. To see that #{i;\bar{m}} is the unique such map, we observe that all morphisms #{\bar{u}\DispTo{m}\bar{x}} factor uniquely through #{\bar{m}} over #{\Idn{u}} as a consequence of #{\bar{m}} being hypocartesian.}
