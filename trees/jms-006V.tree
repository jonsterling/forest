\p{If you intend to [embed #{\LaTeX}-rendered diagrams](tfmt-000L) in your [forest](tfmt-000R), you will need to have a working installation of #{\LaTeX} installed, such as [TeX Live](https://tug.org/texlive/). If all your mathematical expressions are supported by [#{\KaTeX}](https://katex.org/), this is not necessary.}
