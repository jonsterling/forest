\p{Assuming the [axiom of choice](frct-003J), any [cartesian fibration](frct-0002) may be equipped with a (non-canonical) [cleaving](frct-003T). In the current version of these notes, we freely use this principle, but in the future we would like to follow [Ahrens and Lumsdaine](ahrens-lumsdaine-2019) in distinguishing between \em{weak} and \em{strong} fibrations, in which the latter come equipped with cleavings.}
