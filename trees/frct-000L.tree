\p{An ordinary category #{C} is equivalent to a globally small category if and only if the [family fibration](frct-0006) #{\FAM{C}} has a [generic object](frct-001E).}

\proof{
\p{To see that this is the case, suppose that #{C} has a set of objects. Then #{C\in\SET} and we define #{\lfloor{C}\rfloor} to be the displayed object #{\brc{x}\Sub{x\in C}\in \FAM{C}[C]}. Fixing #{I\in \SET} and #{z\in C^I}, we consider the cartesian map displayed over #{z : I \to C}:}

\tex{
  \DiagramSquare{
    height = 1.5cm,
    width = 3cm,
    west/style = lies over,
    east/style = lies over,
    sw = I,
    se = C,
    south = z,
    ne = \brc{x}\Sub{x\in C},
    nw = {z = \brc{z\,i}\Sub{i\in I}}
  }
}

\p{Conversely assume that #{\FAM{C}} has a generic object #{\bar{u}\in\FAM{C}[U]} for some #{U\in \SET}; then we may equip #{U} with the structure of a globally small category such that #{U} is equivalent to #{C}, using the canonical [cleaving of the family fibration](frct-003V). In particular, given #{\Mor{x,y}{1}{U}} we define a morphism from #{x} to #{y} to be given by a vertical map #{\Mor{h}{\InvImg{x}{\bar{u}}}{\InvImg{y}{\bar{u}}}} in #{\FAM{C}\brk{1}\simeq C}.}
