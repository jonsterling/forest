\p{A “tool for scientific thought” could be many things, but it must be a tool for the \strong{development} and \strong{interlinking} of scientific ideas in a way that facilitates \strong{authoring}, \strong{publishing}, \strong{teaching}, \strong{learning}, and the maintenance of \strong{[evergreen notes](tfmt-0003)}.}

\p{A tool for scientific thought could be a piece of software, or it could be an organizing principle for physical notes on paper. In these notes, we will primarily explore the design of computerized tools for scientific thought.}
