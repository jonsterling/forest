\meta{venue}{Workshop on the Implementation of Type Systems (keynote)}
\p{For six years, I have served as the founder and technical leader of the RedPRL Development Team which has produced three interactive proof assistants for variants of cubical type theory: RedPRL, redtt, and cooltt. I will share several lessons that we have learned about the design and implementation of homotopical proof assistants along this journey. This talk discusses joint work with \span{\class{person}\a{\href{https://cs.cmu.edu/~cangiuli/}C. Angiuli}}, \span{\class{person}\a{\href{https://staff.math.su.se/evan.cavallo/}E. Cavallo}}, \span{\class{person}\a{\href{https://www.favonia.org/}Favonia}}, \span{\class{person}\a{\href{http://cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/}R.
