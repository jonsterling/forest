\p{A third achievement of the \TypeSynth project was to extend the highly successful “[Synthetic Tait Computability](jms-005T)” method, developed in my [doctoral thesis](sterling-2021-thesis), to the case of realistic programming languages with computational effects. The purpose of this extension was to achieve strong representation independence results, by which we can show the computational indistinguishability of even two programs that allocate memory cells of different types that are linked not by a bijection but by a mere relation, in contrast to univalent reference types. We have gone quite a bit beyond our expectations, as our account of [[STC](jms-005T) for higher-order store](sterling-gratzer-birkedal-2022) applies not only to the simple polymorphic store model, but also to the full dependent type theory. This allows many classic results from the literature that previously required very complicated reasoning with the semantic model to be reconstructed in a simpler and more direct fashion.}
