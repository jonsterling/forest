\p{This website is a “[forest](tfmt-000V)”, where I organize my thoughts on a variety of topics at a granular level. Sometimes these thoughts are [self-contained](tfmt-0007), and at times I may organize them into larger [notebooks](jms-0047) or [lecture notes](frct-003I). My nascent ideas about the design of [tools for mathematical thought](tfmt-0002) are [here](tfmt-0001). I welcome collaboration on any of the topics represented in my forest.
