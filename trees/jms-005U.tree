\p{This website is a “[forest](tfmt-000V)” created using the [Forester](jms-005P) tool. I organize my thoughts here on a variety of topics at a granular level; sometimes these thoughts are [self-contained](tfmt-0007), and at times I may organize them into larger [notebooks](jms-0047) or [lecture notes](frct-003I). My nascent ideas about the design of [tools for scientific thought](tfmt-0002) are [here](tfmt-0001). I welcome collaboration on any of the topics represented in my forest. To navigate my forest, press \code{Ctrl-K}.}
