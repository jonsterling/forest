\p{A class of families of sets #{\mathfrak{F}} is said to be \em{definable} when it is stable and moreover, for any family of sets #{\prn{S\Sub{i}}\Sub{i\in I}}, there exists a subset #{J\subseteq I} such that the base change #{\prn{S\Sub{j}}\Sub{j\in J}} lies in #{\mathfrak{F}}, and moreover, such that #{u:K\to I} factors through #{J\subseteq I} whenever the base change #{\prn{S\Sub{uk}}\Sub{k\in K}} lies in #{\mathfrak{F}}.}
