\p{
  It will of course depend on the student, but I am preferring to recruit students with some existing mathematical maturity (and this could be in any area of mathematics, not just category theory). \strong{The purpose of Bachelors and Masters-level mathematical training is not to learn a specific topic but rather to \em{learn how to learn} any topic whatsoever.} In short, I do not care if you do not know what a natural transformation is, but it will be a problem if it would take you more than twenty minutes to find out what a natural transformation is.
