\title{small fibrations and internal categories}

\import{base-macros}


\p{The purpose of this section is to develop the relationship between \em{internal
  categories} (categories defined in the internal language of a category #{B}) and
cartesian fibrations over #{B}, generalizing the relationship between categories internal
to #{\SET} (i.e. small categories) and their family fibrations over #{\SET}.}
