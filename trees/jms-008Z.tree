\p{This release adds support for “wikilinks” in the form \code{\startverb[[destination]]\stopverb}; this will be rendered as a link whose title is given by the title of the tree at address \code{destination}. Users are discouraged from using wikilinks heavily, as it is better for your mind to “work a link into a sentence” naturally; but this can be very useful for linking to [biographical trees](jms-007K) or daily notes.}
