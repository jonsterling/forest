\p{We contribute XTT, a cubical reconstruction of Observational Type Theory [Altenkirch et al., 2007] which extends Martin-LÃ¶f's intensional type theory with a dependent equality type that enjoys function extensionality and a judgmental version of the unicity of identity proofs principle (UIP): any two elements of the same equality type are judgmentally equal. Moreover, we conjecture that the typing relation can be decided in a practical way. In this paper, we establish an algebraic canonicity theorem using a novel extension of the logical families or categorical gluing argument inspired by Coquand and Shulman [Coquand, 2018; Shulman, 2015]: every closed element of boolean type is derivably equal to either true or false.}
