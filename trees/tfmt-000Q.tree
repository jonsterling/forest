\p{A [forest of evergreen notes](tfmt-000R) may in general contain the work of many authors: for example, the tree on [constructive domain theory](jms-001E) comprises mathematical contributions of not only the present author, but also Martín Escardó and Tom de Jong. However, the correct attribution of authorship to a given tree is more subtle than one might at first think.}

\p{To understand this subtlety, we first consider that each individual tree may contain \em{both} textual content and transcluded subtrees. Thinking inductively, a simple model of tree authorship would be to take the union of the authors of the immediate textual content and the authors of all trees within its [extent](tfmt-000U). This model is incorrect, however, as authorship is usually taken to imply responsibility and endorsement, as can be seen by way of example from the [ACM Policy on Authorship, Peer Review, Readership, and Conference Publication](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/roles-and-responsibilities):}

  \p{They agree to be held accountable for any issues relating to the correctness or integrity of the work with the understanding that depending on the circumstances not all authors are necessarily held “equally” accountable. In the case of publications-related misconduct, it may be the case that penalties may vary for co-authors listed on a single publication.}}


\p{In particular, although one person may be aware of and responsible for the content of a given tree, it would be unreasonable to require them to be responsible for any subsequent (and potentially erroneous!) re-contextualization of that tree in the forest. For this reason, \strong{[authors](tfmt-000S) must be distinguished from [contributors](tfmt-000T)} in [forests of evergreen notes](tfmt-000R).}
