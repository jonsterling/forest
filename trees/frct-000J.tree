\title{globally small fibrations}
\author{jonmsterling}

\p{In ordinary category theory, a category #{C} is called \em{small} when the objects of #{C} can be arranged into a set, and so can for every #{x,y\in C} the collection of morphisms #{x\to y}. It is useful to separate these two conditions when we generalize them to fibrations. The latter is called [\em{local smallness}](frct-000F); the former is called \em{global smallness} by [Jacobs](jacobs-1999) and factors through an important concept: the \em{generic object}.}
