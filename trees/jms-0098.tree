\p{I do not recruit students to work on a specific project of mine. I do not run a “lab” or partake in “lab science”; for example, it would \em{not} be a successful outcome for you to make the fifteenth extension to a large project of mine that has consumed the lives of several of your predecessors. \strong{My job is to train you to be an independent researcher, drawn forward by your own scientific interest and burning questions.} In doing so, I will do my best to guide you toward good questions, and provide technical training through collaboration on my projects, but in the end the responsibility for your scientific program is yours.}
