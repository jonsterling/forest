  \p{I am interested in developing logical and algebraic approaches for understanding the structure of computation. Most of my work is centred around the semantic modelling of programming languages. In this endeavour I find that type theory and category theory are particularly useful in uncovering the structure of programs, circumscribing their possible behaviours, and relating them to various mathematical models.}
