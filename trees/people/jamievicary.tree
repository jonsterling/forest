  My research aims to develop new logical and structural techniques, with the goal to transform the way we compute in the future, across a range of areas including quantum and classical computation. A lot of my research uses the tools of category theory, a rich abstract language for understanding how interacting systems process information. I am also interested in studying category theory itself, finding ways to make it more powerful and easier to use. I work as part of the [Cambridge Logical Structures Hub (CLASH)](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/clash/) research group in the department.
