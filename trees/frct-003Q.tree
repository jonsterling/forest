\p{Let #{\bar{u}} be a displayed object in a [locally small](frct-001B) fibration #{E} over #{B}. We will define the [internal category](frct-001A) #{\Intrn{\bar{u}}} in #{B} associated to #{\bar{u}}. In particular, we let the object of objects #{\Intrn{\bar{u}}\Sub{0}} be #{u} itself; defining the object of arrows #{\Intrn{\bar{u}}\Sub{1}} is more complex, making critical use of the local smallness of #{E} over #{B}.}

\p{We will think of the fiber category #{E\Sub{u\times u}} as the category of objects indexed in the \em{boundary} (source and target) of a morphism. Restricting #{\bar{u}} along the source and target projections, we obtain the displayed objects of “points of the source” and “points of the target” respectively:}

\p{Because #{E} is [locally small](frct-001B), there is an object
#{\Hom{E\Sub{u\times u}}{\bar\partial\Sub{1}}{\bar\partial\Sub{2}}\in \Sl{B}{u\times u}} that
behaves as the “generic hom set”. We define #{\Intrn{\bar{u}}\Sub{1}\in B} and its
source and target projections to be this very object.}
