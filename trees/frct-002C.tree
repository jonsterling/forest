\title{hypocartesian = cartesian in a cartesian fibration}
\taxon{lemma}

\import{frct-0000}

\p{Let #{E} be a [cartesian fibration](frct-0002), and let #{\DispMor{\bar{f}}{f}{\bar{x}}{\bar{y}}} be displayed over #{\Mor{f}{x}{y}}. The displayed morphism #{\bar{f}} is [cartesian](frct-0001) if and only if it is [hypocartesian](frct-002A).}

\proof{
  \p{Any cartesian map is clearly hypocartesian. To see that a hypocartesian map #{\DispMor{\bar{f}}{f}{\bar{x}}{\bar{y}}} in a cartesian fibration is cartesian, we consider the cartesian lift of #{\Mor{f}{x}{y}} under #{\bar{y}}:}

  \tex{
    \DiagramSquare{
      height = 1.5cm,
      west/style = lies over,
      east/style = lies over,
      nw/style = pullback,
      nw = \bar{x}\tick,
      ne = \bar{y},
      se = y,
      sw = x,
      south = f,
      north = \bar{f}\tick,
      north/style = {->,exists},
    }
  }

  \p{As the cartesian lift #{\bar{x}\tick\to \bar{y}} is also hypocartesian, it follows that there is a unique vertical isomorphism identifying #{\bar{x}} with #{\bar{x}\tick} factoring #{\DispMor{\bar{f}}{f}{\bar{x}}{\bar{y}}} through #{\DispMor{\bar{f}\tick}{f}{\bar{x}\tick}{\bar{y}}}. Being cartesian over #{f} is clearly stable under isomorphism, hence we conclude that #{\bar{f}} is cartesian from the fact that #{\bar{f}\tick} is cartesian.}
