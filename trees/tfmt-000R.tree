\p{A \em{forest of [evergreen notes](tfmt-0003)} (or a \em{forest} for short) is loosely defined to be a collection of [evergreen notes](tfmt-0003) in which multiple [hierarchical structures](tfmt-0005) are allowed to emerge and evolve over time. Concretely, one note may contextualize several other notes via transclusion within its textual structure; in the context of a forest, we refer to an individual note as a \em{tree}. Of course, a tree can be viewed as a forest that has a root node.}
