\p{Can the Phoa axiom in synthetic domain theory be deduced from [synthetic quasicoherence](jms-008T)? I believe that Paul Taylor may have commented on something in this direction once in MathOverflow, but I do not know if anyone has proved this. I think it could be an interesting test-case. In cases where we have a clean understanding of the geometric theory in question (as in simplicial sets), this might be feasible; but I wonder about more sophisticated models of synthetic domain theory.}
