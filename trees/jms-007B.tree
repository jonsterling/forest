\p{The results of the \TypeSynth project have gone significantly beyond the state of the art in denotational semantics for computational effects: not only is ours the first typed denotational model of higher-order store compatible with parametric polymorphism, but we have shown that the same construction also gives rise to a model of [full dependent type theory with higher-order store](sterling-gratzer-birkedal-2022) — a long sought-after result whose implications we have not yet fully exploited. Our model of [“univalent reference types”](sterling-gratzer-birkedal-2023-univalent) is also a significant break with the state of the art, and points the way to a new and more fruitful interaction between the fields of programming languages on the one hand, and homotopy type theory and algebraic topology on the other hand.}

\p{The [technical achievements](jms-0077) of \TypeSynth point to healthy growth in the long-neglected area of denotational semantics and equational program logics, but there is an urgent need for further research to bring these superior but comparatively less-developed methods to practical parity with the more established operational paradigm, which currently achieves stronger results in program verification — which we believe can be accounted for by the twenty-year headstart enjoyed by teams favoring operational methods during the relative dormancy of semantic and categorical methods in programming languages. }
