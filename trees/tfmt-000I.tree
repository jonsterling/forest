\p{The [quiver](https://q.uiver.app/) application is an excellent graphical interface for interactively constructing commutative diagrams, with very high-quality rendering.}

\p{One positive aspect of quiver is that it is possible to load it with [your own macro library](tfmt-000F), so that diagrams involving custom notations render correctly in the graphical interface. The downside of the approach here is that the macro library must be located on a publicly accessible URL that can be pasted into the quiver interface.}

\p{Quiver also offers excellent support for embedding the resulting diagrams in existing #{\LaTeX} documents: after creating your diagram, you can request a #{\LaTeX} snippet that includes a URL which allows you to resume editing your diagram. For example:}

\code{\pre{\startverb%
% https://q.uiver.app/?q=WzAsMixbMCwwLCJBIl0sWzEsMCwiQiJdLFswLDFdXQ==
\[
  \begin{tikzcd}
    A & B
    \arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]
  \end{tikzcd}
\]
\stopverb}}

\p{\strong{Unfortunately, the support for embedding quiver diagrams in HTML documents is currently inadequate for professional use.} The HTML embed code provided simply produces an \code{\startverb<iframe>\stopverb} with a very large watermark, and it is not possible to style the interior of the embedded frame (e.g. to change the background color, or decrease the margins):}

\code{\pre{\startverb%
<!-- https://q.uiver.app/?q=WzAsMixbMCwwLCJBIl0sWzEsMCwiQiJdLFswLDFdXQ== -->
<iframe class="quiver-embed" src="https://q.uiver.app/?q=WzAsMixbMCwwLCJBIl0sWzEsMCwiQiJdLFswLDFdXQ==&embed" width="304" height="176" style="border-radius: 8px; border: none;"></iframe>
\stopverb}}

\p{Therefore, we must conclude that although quiver is an excellent tool for authors of traditional #{\LaTeX} documents, it is not currently a candidate for inclusion in tools for hypertext mathematical authoring.}
