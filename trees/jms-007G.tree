\p{\Forester renders your \forest to some XML files in the \code{output/} directory; XML is, like HTML, a format for structured documents that can be displayed by web browsers. The \forest template comes equipped with a built-in XSLT stylesheet (\code{assets/forest.xsl}) which is used to instruct web browsers how to render your \forest into a pleasing and readable format.}
